acid
====

'acid' is A Continuous Integration Daemon.

The aim of this project is to provide a trivial CI daemon for Gitea.
I find most alternatives way too complex to set up and run in a local setting,
while the gist of it is actually very simple--run some stuff on new git commits.

'acid' provides a simple web frontend, as well as a webhook endpoint
for notifications about new commits.  The daemon is supposed to be "firewalled"
by a normal HTTP server, and as such it will not provide TLS support to secure
communications.

'acid' runs tasks over SSH, which should be universal enough.
It can tell you the build results via any method you can put in a shell script.

Getting it to work
------------------
 # apt install git golang asciidoctor
 $ git clone https://git.janouch.name/p/acid.git
 $ cd acid
 $ make
 $ man -l acid.1

You will need to write your own runner scripts, which may be nontrivial.
The author suggests using __cloud-init__-enabled virtual machines with QEMU.
